pain itself is love, the main pain, for the pain of the consequences. but in order that the least of them should come to work, and some pleasure should arise, 
who is bound by any school. to take a trivial example, who of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? but no one 
rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that 
are extremely painful. nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but occasionally circumstances occur 
in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure.
